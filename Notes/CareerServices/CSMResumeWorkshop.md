# What makes a good resume

- Purpose

- Impact Statements
- Structure
- Do's and Don'ts


## Inverted(?) Pyramid
Most important thing at the top


# 1. What is the point of the resume
- Provide a snapshot of you as NOW
- You With your past experiences
- Employers are looking for Qualifications
    - If you are the solution to the problem they are looking for
    - They Only Look at what stands out
- A resume is important to get your foot in the door
    - The Actual interview is how you land the job

- THE RESUME BLACK HOLE
- They automate to reduce the amount applications they get
- Every ATS you're gambling on what the ATS is stated for

## Beat that Blackhole
- Keywords from the Job Description into Cover letter and Resume
- Insert Job Description into Resume in Small/white font -> Do NOT do this....
- Standard Word or PDF files. 
    - Save the custom resume for in person meeting
- Reach out to a human to let them know you applied

# 3. Action Words
- If you don't have action words you just get dropped into the black hole.
- Employers take 20 Seconds to Review resume before having an impression.
- Scanning out Active words and giving a sense of experience
## They Assist in making experience speak to the fullest
## Help Define what job responsibliites are
## Highlight skills to the reader without making them work too hard
