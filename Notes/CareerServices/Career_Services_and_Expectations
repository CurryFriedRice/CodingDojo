Eric Smith - Awesome Dog Backgrounds
==========
Took 3 Months after Graduating Coding Dojo
IT 13 years, No coding background.
More DevOps versus Infrastructure

Site REliablity and DevOps engineer
Brings group into Infrastructure as Code
do things in AWS instead of spinning up a server and making sure the server works
Moving scripts off of powershell into Python. Powershell is strong but requires a lot to code. 
Just calling modules instead of running it.

30 people. Still very small. mid is at 50ish
Taking Prospects from Epic? 
Taking on Bigger Clients
Rack and stack; Worked with AT&T and got a DevOps

Keep contacts From old people... Yeah, it is helpful...

Q to Eric
How many Jobs Apps Post Grad?
A lot, Definately a lot of applications. 5-6 a Day. Applying for Jobs is the shortest part... Depends on how detailed it needs to be
Resume + Cover Letter. Linked in Shoot into the abyss... So nothing new...
Continuing coding and doing projects is the longer harder part... Ehhh Depends on how complex the project is...

Few Hundred Applications.

Yes the Fire and forget, Just throw it into the abyss and see if you hear back.

Working on algorithms and Coding every day. Yeah that's easy... I've done it... I love it but also it doesn't work

Google search and see who reaches out. Glassdoor and LinkedIn
Research and Interviews are the majority of time.

Benjaman Snapshot of aftergrad
==========
In Program: Series of assignments and deliverables with programatic 1 on 1s
Three IN PROGRAM...
All components are essientially the same; Cadence and ordering is different.
Career services Track; Be ready the day you graduate or very soon after.
Build Momentum and bring it into job search
Resume Workshop in Program post Python Workshop. 

Associate with most recent work. Which is good... It's a pain though

Narrative Piece - Speak about yourself how you want to present yourself from the past to new direction

Find opportunity in backgrounds.

Develop Direction and interests. Yeah that's easy.... Like Really easy... Pick an area to explore and understand.

FINAL WORKSHOP
Strategy workshop in Job search.
3 Buckets - Least to most
    * Applications
    * Networking
    * Projects and self learning.

Some would ask how to solve real world problems
Sometimes it's here's stuff solve it.

Just let the CSM beat you up. Yeah I'm not against it... Life and stuff is trash

For someone who does reviews... they sure as heck are not very savvy about it...

Put Coding Dojo into Professional Experience
Put in Projects...

Video Demos straight to projcet.

Show off the 
Prioritize Projects

Skills and Endorsements are important... That seems bullshit.... And questionable to me....

Recommendations as well from specific people. 

==========
What advice career wise can you give, Companies and whatnot
==========

Find the work that you enjoy Dur.... I like that backend and mid end stuff. Organizing data is fun and someone needs to do it. But I also like to do presentation, Over to top and extreme to pull people in.

Front End   | What people see and how they see it
Back End    | How it process the data of what needs to be gotten or sent
Database    | The Library of the Entire system

Roles that make use of skillsets from prior professions

Full Stacks are Back End Heavy 
Front End Roles want people who have FULL STACK knowledge

Front End role ties everything together.

Math Centric is full stack
Consider Working on backend and server as much as you can.

You should have an understanding of everything, So you can communicate with others to ensure that everything works smoothly.

Work on algo work during Free Time.

Data Science is tricky... You'll know more about python than neccessary but not the statistical maths.
Data Anlytics or Administrator as a starting point

Fullstack Gigs are more common than just straight into a specific role.

Coding Dojo gives you a starting point for data bases.

Back end Requries a bit more data and ideas to manage massive amounts of data... That sounds really fun. Finding Elegant ways to process data. 

Big companies vs Start Ups
The FAAANG companies = Facebook Apple Amazon AirBnB Netflix Google

Microsoft is MORE accessible... Which is great since that's where I want to head
Tons of Variation dependant on the team.

Small Startups are Dynamic. Very Chaotic (Not my cup of tea.... I like chaos but that controlled chaos). 
It's more localized Code reviews and Onboarding. Dropped in hit the ground running.
Do the research and build new stuff. 


Big More infrastructure, Guidance and Mentorship
That bigger company you don't get noticed, which is fine... Since I don't need attention from EVERYONE. As long as it works properly and people don't know I think it's fine. Not EVERYONE needs to be a hero.

A reason why we won't get jobs soon is because recruiters, Should be working with Recruiters?
No... Not really... You just Need to have someone on the inside that can refer you to the team. 
Not a fan of PURE numbers job search. Worked when there were fewer bootcamps.

Do some Hype work, Get to know people; Recruiters looking for middle to senior so they can get a bigger cut... So screw them if you want a senior level position get it yourself. Being there instantly is bad since you don't know what's going on.
Yes... Recruiters that hold you hostage and make you don't get benefits while under contract.

Try to get that internal Referral. Erin Palmer, Eric Ngo, Justin Ngo, Find People, 
Most GOOD referrals get people paid. Alex got 3K for Julian's hire so it's obvious that they're incentivised to do it. 

You're gonna get a lot of BS "Hey we're looking for this and that" which is bullshit. You aren't a recruiter, They have no idea what you're doing and they're gonna take your money. Screw recruiters again....

You don't need a Mentor you need a fucking job. Ask the Alumni for help, They'll know better. 

Revature... An organization that is not sketchy but they give you training and then you get contracted out for two years...
It's to accrue experience at the cost of potentially losing money. They are focusing down on locations though so you're gonna be put in places. 

Utilize Alumni, Career Service Manager (CSM), Hearing where is a great company and how much they enjoyed

Trust the process and humble yourself, you've paid them money, yeah no shit you know how broken I am... I've shouted so loud

CSM relies on Email a LOT. So keep them in the loop and help them help you. Career services is most likely More imporant than the actual bootcamp. It's who you know not what you know. Start Hunting Hunter.
