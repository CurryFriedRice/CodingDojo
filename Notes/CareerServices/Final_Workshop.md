# Foundation of a successful search

3 Buckets of Job Searching
* Applying
* Networking
* Continued learning and study

Foundation of the 3 buckets => Momentum and Consistency

Time management and Organization
Goal: Eliminate all guesswork from waht you should be doing at any given time
Calenderizing
Make the calendar a thing.... Fuuuuuuuuuuuck

What should be tracked?
ALL Applications, links to JDs Company Websites, follow up efforts/dates
- Just use the spreadsheet....

tracking = data - it's so they can call you out on it.
Track Recruiting agencies.
