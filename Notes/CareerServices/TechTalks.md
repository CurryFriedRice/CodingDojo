# TechTalk w/ Career Sprout & Katie McIntyre (West)

## End thoughts
* They always talk about how much they're making... not for how long they're making it
* This seems like Coding Dojo has partnered themselves with a different company to take money from people...
* What kind of pyramid scheme is this...

  * Well if they keep getting sign on bonuses That explains why the general quality of things has gone down....
  * Look at Youtube, Look at Netflix, Look at Amazon, Look at Microsoft. 
  * Look at ANY game company

## Presentation
- Does not matter what you are worth now, it's what you're going to be worth
- NOT about getting paid undeservingly

### The Old Model
| Item         | Price     | # In stock | # In stock |
|--------------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Juicy Apples |  Unbalanced Life | Network  | Settle Because you have to        |
| Honeymoon Phase | **1.89**  | 5234       | 5234       |

- Pick a career -> Unbalanced Life -> Network -> Settle Because you have to
- Honeymoon Phase -> Stressed Out -> Try to apply -> watch people pass
- Stagnation -> Unfullfilled -> Try to interview -> retire
- Appeptance 4 years into 40 year career -> Try to pivot -> try to negotiate -> regret

- This seems like clout or a get rich quick scheme....


## 1: Define career Nirvana
## 2: Build resume and Linked in Profile
- How will you know...? People will be reaching out to you.... Right....
## 3: Interviews

## How to build Rapport
* Ask questions
    * Make it natural...
    * Treat your interviewer as a friend

### Interviewer is looking to Answer
1. Can this person do the job....
2. Can I stand working with this person for a long term project
* No one wants to spend time about someone who talks about themselves
* But ya know... Get them to talk about themselves so they feel special
* 

## Hacks
- Hack #1 : Ask why they wanted to hire you
- Hack #2 : Calm yourself down. You're gonnabe nervous but just calm down and show confidence
- Sub Hack: Breathing... I know this... Breathe in breathe out
- Hack #3 : The interviewer wants to feel special.... Yeah and you should manipulate them for that
  - How did you get here?
  - What about you? What a situatiion that you were in a time crunch but made it through 
- Hack #4 : Say thanks a bunch and ask a question. Ask if there are any hesitations
  - If they like it bring it forward to the next interview. 
  - If they don't like it then try to clear it up for them
  - Shows you can handle criticism... But ya know... Still remain at least a little prideful

# It takes steps
- Obviously... Just step it up *slowly*

# Follow up
Write a thank you letter that matches the role description. 

DO NOT send a new email. Go back to the original email and change the topic line and thank them for the update

## 1: Career Nirvana
## 2: Resume and Linked In
## 3: Do the interview
## 4: Negotiate
- Give them 3 Options
  - Higher Salary
  - Perks: Benefits and Vacation
  - Stock options and sign on bonuses
## 5: Invest in Mentorship and talk to people who have actually been there
- What the actual fuck... That's a bad analogy...
- If you could charter a plane or fly if yourself
    - Well most planes are autopilot


# 1 : Go it alone and don't know what's going on
# 2 : Learn the stupid system and abuse the fuck out of it... Because people aren't people... They're idiots, myself included
