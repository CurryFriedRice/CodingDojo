===== Algorithm Session =====

Conditionals....

Don't mix && and || statements? 
That seems like a silly thing... especially if they're going to run the same code

=== Work Session ===

Think about what's effecting what with CSS

if one element is taking care of the "spacing" for certain parts 
the others shouldn't mess with them others worry about it

Work outside inward, get content inside before final outside adjustments

Margin is non visual size
Border is seperation betwee margin and Padding
Padding is visual size
Content is content....
