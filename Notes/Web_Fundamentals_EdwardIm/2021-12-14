Talking variables
Be specifc with what the variable should Be

it's actually two lines, as it should be. 
1. Declaring what data structure the variable is
2. DEclaring what the value is 

Since Javascript is generous the var can be anything it wants;

Modulo will return base if the base value is less than Modulo value
1 % 3 = 2;

JS is kind of a jerk and if you use a string it'll all be strings

JS 'vars' are declared GLOBALLY;
