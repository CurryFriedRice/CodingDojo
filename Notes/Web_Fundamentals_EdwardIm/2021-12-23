APIs

3rd Party API
Gives us Services and Information

Req Res model
Fetch Operates through an Asynchronous Javascript and XML e.g. AJAX

Sometimes a server may not get a response; A server may not get a response so don't execute the rest of the code...

Though Also Do try to wait a for awhile to see if successful or unsuccessful respones.

Async/Await key terms before 'function' call
Await to wait for a response before continuing

Async function Name()
    {
        do stuff
        *await fetch (api)
    }

So with Async we can tell the JS to await until a step is complete.
Await pushes it to become Sychronous Code;

It's Asynchronous because we don't know if it's successful or not

This is for Async Code after persay a fetch function
    .then()
    .catch()

Make the API call dynamic we can call by concatanating to the URL we're fetching to.

e.g. Weather APIs 

The API is only as good as the documentation provided and have standards. 
At the end of the day though they're Human... Go read the documentation.
