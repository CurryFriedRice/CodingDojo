    Position Fixed
    Position Relative

----- Relative -----
It's in relation to the origin Position

Position we are using Directions Top Bottom Left Right
    - Akin to Padding? 
    - It pushes from that direction to the opposite 
    - can be negative

The box model doesn't change but the elements move when the position is changed
So you can get overlaying elements if not careful

Position that STICKS to the page in that position regardless of the screen position

----- Absolute -----
It depends on the Parent Component


----- Sticky -----
Sticks it to the edge of the screen
