//So typically we'd use the ReactDOM.render.
ReactDOM.render(
    <React.strictMode>
        <BrowserRouter>
            <App />
        </BrowserRouter>
    </React.strictMode>
)

Routing we're just passing in values from the URL to the component

#
```
npm install react
npm install react-router-dom@5
```

# react && react-router-dom

UseState    - Helps us save data to a variable
useEffect   - Helps us do a thing when a state finishes rendering or finishes running

useHistory - Helps us change the url path by pushing History
useParams  - Helps us fetch variables in the url route
