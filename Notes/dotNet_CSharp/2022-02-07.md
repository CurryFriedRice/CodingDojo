#### Making a Message
``` C#
//Constructor
public class Message
{
    public string Content {get; set;}
    //This would be the basic setup with get/set and default value
    public DateTime CreatedAt {get;set;} = DateTime.Now;

    public Message(string content)
    {
        Content = content;
    }

}

    //The ? denotes that the value can be null
    public int? 

    //$ means the it is a string Literal
    //@ means that the it follows the formatting with line breaks
    $@
```
