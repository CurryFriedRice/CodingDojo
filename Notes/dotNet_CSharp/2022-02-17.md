# Hash Table
object of keys and strings

The hash has a constant value that we reference.

Hashes the key into the a number then uses an array to store the data.
We don't need to remember the data, just the key.


methods are not added to the DB if they are on an object

You can have a Model.IsValid to check after you use Model.AddModelError 

```C#
if (Model.IsValid)
{
    
    if(user.findemail == true)
    {
        Model.AddModelError("Email", "Email already in use")
    }
}
```



So we can create a property to "fetch" the user's UID after they log in 

```C#
    private int? uid
    {
        get
        {
            HttpContext.session GetInt32("uid");
        }
    }


    public bool LoggedIn
    {
        get
        {
            return uid != null;
        }
    }
```


Look into Parameterizing the log in check
```
[LoggedIn]
[HttpGet("Path")]
public IActionReturn BLAH()
{
    return View()
}
```

Currying?

Take a function and break it down into smaller functions.

```

function applySales (cost salePercent)
{
    return cost - (cost* salePercent)
}

function halfOff(cost)
{
    return applySales(cost, 0.5)
}

function applySalesCurried(sales)
{
    return function (cost)
    {
        return cost - (cost * salesPct);
    }
}

//returns an inner function that a second set of parenths can handle

applySalesCurried(0.50)(100);

const halfPrice = applySaliesCurried(0.5)
halfPrice(100) => 50

The const makes it so it cannot be changed and it's going to be that First value and second case.

function TakeDamage(Percent)
{
    return function(amount)
    {
        return (amount * percent)
    }
}

e.g. 
const totalDamage = TakeDamage(0.75)

totalDamage(100) => 75

```

JS functions are first class citizens You can just pass them stuff
In other languages You would


```
String.Join(", ", Model.Likes())
```
