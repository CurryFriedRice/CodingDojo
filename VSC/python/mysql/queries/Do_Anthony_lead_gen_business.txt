-- Queries
-- 1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?
-- SELECT MONTHNAME(charged_datetime) AS month, SUM(amount) AS revenue FROM billing 
-- WHERE billing.charged_datetime >= DATE('2012/03/01') AND billing.charged_datetime < '2012/04/01'

-- 2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?
-- SELECT client_id , SUM(amount) FROM billing
-- WHERE client_id = 2;

-- 3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client with an id of 10 owns?
-- SELECT client_id, sites.domain_name From sites 
-- WHERE client_id = 10;

-- 4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per 
-- month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client with an id of 20?
-- SELECT sites.client_id, COUNT(MONTH(created_datetime)) AS 'sites created', MONTHNAME(created_datetime) AS 'month_created', YEAR(created_datetime) FROM clients 
-- JOIN sites on clients.client_id = sites.client_id
-- WHERE sites.client_id = 1 GROUP BY sites.created_datetime;

-- SELECT sites.client_id, COUNT(MONTH(created_datetime)) AS 'sites created', MONTHNAME(created_datetime) AS 'month_created', YEAR(created_datetime) FROM clients 
-- JOIN sites on clients.client_id = sites.client_id
-- WHERE sites.client_id = 20 GROUP BY sites.created_datetime;

-- 5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads

-- SELECT sites.domain_name, COUNT(leads_id)  FROM sites
-- JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
-- WHERE registered_datetime > '2011/01/01' AND registered_datetime < '2011/02/15'
-- GROUP BY sites.domain_name;

-- 6. What query would you run to get a list of client names

-- between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?
-- SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, " " ,clients.last_name) AS 'name', COUNT(leads.site_id) FROM clients
-- JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id

-- WHERE leads.registered_datetime >= '2011/01/01' AND leads.registered_datetime < '2011/12/31'  
-- GROUP BY clients.client_id;

-- 7. What query would you run to get a list of client names 
-- and the total # of leads we've generated for each client 
-- each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?
-- SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name), COUNT(leads.leads_id), MONTHNAME(leads.registered_datetime) FROM clients
-- JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id

-- 8. What query would you run to get a list of client names 
-- and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients'
-- sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id. 
-- Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), 
-- and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.
-- SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name) AS client, sites.domain_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) FROM clients
-- JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id

-- GROUP BY sites.domain_name
-- ORDER BY clients.client_id, sites.domain_name

-- SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name) AS client, sites.domain_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) FROM clients
-- JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
-- JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
-- GROUP BY sites.domain_name
-- ORDER BY clients.client_id, sites.domain_name

-- 9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client 
-- for each month of the year. Order it by client id.  
-- First try this with integer month, second with month name.  
-- A SELECT subquery will be needed for the second challenge.  Look at this for a hint.
-- A) 
-- SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name) AS 'client name', sum(billing.amount), MONTH(charged_datetime) AS month, YEAR(charged_datetime) AS year FROM billing
-- JOIN clients ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
-- GROUP BY YEAR(billing.charged_datetime), MONTH(billing.charged_datetime),clients.client_id
-- ORDER BY billing.client_id, YEAR(billing.charged_datetime), MONTH(billing.charged_datetime);
-- B)
-- SELECT 	CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client,
-- 		SUM(billing.amount) AS total_revenue,
--         MONTHNAME(billing.charged_datetime) AS month_charge,
--         YEAR(billing.charged_datetime) AS year_charge
-- FROM billing
-- JOIN clients USING (client_id)
-- GROUP BY YEAR(charged_datetime), MONTH(charged_datetime), clients.client_id
-- ORDER BY billing.client_id, YEAR(charged_datetime), MONTH(charged_datetime);

-- 10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. 
-- Group the results so that all of the sites for each client are displayed in a single field. 
-- It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the 
-- client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)
-- SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client, GROUP_CONCAT(sites.domain_name, ' ') AS owned_domains FROM clients
-- LEFT JOIN sites USING (client_id)
-- GROUP BY clients.client_id
